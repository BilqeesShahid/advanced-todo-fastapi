[post_write_hooks]
# post_write_hooks defines scripts or Python functions that are to be
# called automatically after the completion of revision script generation.
#
# The default behavior is to adjust the file permissions of the generated
# migration script to be writable by the current user.
#
# The process which calls the hooks is as follows:
#
# 1. The "output_encoding" is applied to the content of the generated
#    migration script
# 2. The migration script is written to the filesystem
# 3. The configured "post_write_hooks" are called with the filename of
#    the script as an argument
#
# The available keys in each section include:
#
# "type" - can be one of "console", "exec", or "callable"
# "entrypoint" - can be either a console_scripts entrypoint name
#   (when type is "console"), an executable program to run (when type
#   is "exec"), or the dotted module name of a callable function
#   (when type is "callable").
# "arguments" - a comma-separated list of additional string arguments
#   to be passed to the hook
# "chdir" - change directory to the directory of the file before executing
#   the hook (for "exec" and "callable" types)
#
# Use the example below to execute the "black" Python code formatter on each
# newly generated migration script.
#
# [post_write_hooks]
# hooks = black
# black.type = exec
# black.entrypoint = black
# black.arguments = -l 79 REVISION_SCRIPT_FILENAME
